/* Each node in a singly linked list is a structure that contains i) A variable (e.g int data) to store the value you want to keep in that node
ii) A pointer to the next node (e.g., struct node *next) to store the address of the next structure(node) in the list

This self-refrential structure lets you build flexible, dynamic data structure, insert and delete nodes efficiently without shifting all elements(like in arrays)
